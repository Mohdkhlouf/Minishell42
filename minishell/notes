these need to be handleld

- echo "test"$ / echo 'test'
- echo "$"
- echo "$?" - gives exit code of the last command
- echo $$
- echo $$$
- echo "|" //print | not consider it as pipe



- also when there is << heredoc dont expand the variables.


errors:
*/
	minishell> env mo
	env: more than one arguments are not supported
	Command not found.


*/empty commands must be solved correctly

when:
doesntexist

needs to be solved

exit "number" "nonumber" does not exit in bash

- unset PWD
cd libft

thi give seg fault

when unset pwd, and use cd again, it must set the PWD value but will not shown in ENV, same as oldpwd


export adding variable, in the aphabatic order, it works witch capital but not with small.


whoami | cat -e | cat -e > tmp/file 



whoami | cat -e | cat -e > tmp/file 



leak in heredoc:
cat Makefile | rev | echo -e test.txt



/*
minishell$ exit
exit



add check if there is no A2
unset A2
the exit code is faluire
